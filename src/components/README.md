# Components Directory

This directory contains all reusable UI components used throughout the application.

## Organization:
- `ui/`: Shadcn UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- `blog/`: Blog-related components (cards, forms)
- `auth/`: Authentication components (login forms, etc.)
- `books/`: Book management components
- `ai-tools/`: AI tools related components

Each component should be:
- Small and focused on a single responsibility
- Reusable across different pages
- Well-documented with props interfaces
